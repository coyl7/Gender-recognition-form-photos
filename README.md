# Gender classification of images

This is a project for “AI Engineer Development Program” from Feng Chia University in Taiwan.
Which I attended from March of 2021 to May 2021.

The purpose of the project is to utilise transfer learning in order to create a program that can differentiate the gender of figures in provided images.
